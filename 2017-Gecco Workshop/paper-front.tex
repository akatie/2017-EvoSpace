\begin{abstract}

This paper is part of a continuing effort in the field of EC to
develop algorithms that follow an opportunistic approach to computing, allowing the exploitation
of freely available services over the Internet by using free tiers of
cloud services or volunteer computing
resources; the EvoSpace model is able to tap from both kind of
resources, using asynchronous evolutionary algorithms. We present its
design, which follows an an event-driven 
architecture and asynchronous I/O model, and its implementation, with
a server-side tier programmed in Node.js that uses Redis as an
in-memory and high performance data store for the population. This
population store is exposed to clients running population-based and nature-inspired metaheuristics
through a REST API. Additional capabilities where implemented in this version to
allow the logging of experiments where heterogeneous algorithms are executed in parallel.
These logs can then be transformed to other formats. As a case study
an hybrid global optimization algorithm has been implemented mixing
two algorithms: a PSO algorithm from the EvoloPy library and a GA using the DEAP framework.
The result was transformed to files compatible to the Comparing Continuous Optimizer platform
in order to use their post-processing code. Clients in this case have been developed in 
the Python language, the language used to implement both
libraries. The results from this case study suggest, first, that
EvoSpace can be used as a paradigm- and language-agnostic platform for
population-based optimization algorithms, and also that this software can yield
performance improvements and a viable platform to execute and compare asynchronous pool-based
metaheuristics.
