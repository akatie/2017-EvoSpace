\begin{abstract}
Several asynchronous Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been proposed that distribute the
evolutionary process among heterogeneous devices or virtual machines.
In these algorithms the population is shared between distributed worker processes that 
execute the actual evolutionary process by taking samples of the population, and putting back
a replacement of evolved individuals. The performance of these EAs depends in part 
on the selection of parameters for the EA running in each worker, 
along with the overall configuration. Parameters for each worker may include: 
sample size, generations, mutation rate and crossover rate. In this paper, we evaluate in a cloud 
setting, a strategy proposed by Gong and Fukunaga for the Island-Model which statically 
assigns random parameter settings to each island. Experiments were conducted in the amazon
cloud using 2, 6 and 12 virtual machine configurations, with both homogeneous and heterogeneous
random settings using six benchmark optimization problems (OneMax, Rastrigin, Griewank, De Jong,
Schafer and Ackley). The results suggest that this approach can yield results which are competitive to
instances of the algorithm using workers with control parameters tuned specifically for the 
benchmark.
