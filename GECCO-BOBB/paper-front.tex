\begin{abstract}
In this work, we  evaluate an asynchronous population-based 
algorithms following a pool-based approach. In Pool-based 
algorithms a collection of heterogeneous worker processes 
collaborate through a shared population repository. In particular
we followed the EvoSpace approach in which workers 
asynchronously interact with a population pool by taking 
samples of the population to perform a local search on the 
samples, to then return newly evolved solutions back to the 
pool. We benchmark  against the BBOB noiseless testbed a 
hybrid algorithm mixing two kinds or workers:  PSO  and GA. 
The results of the asynchronous execution were transformed 
into files compatible with the Comparing Continuous Optimizer 
platform. We find that an Pool-based approach outperforms
the canonical GA and PSO algorithms in nearly all cases. 
The results from these tests suggest that a Pool Based approach 
can be used to implment hybrid algorithms that can improve 
the performance of single population-based optimization algorithms
